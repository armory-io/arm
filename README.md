# Arm installation

The Armory CLI

To use this you can download the binaries fom the [release section](https://github.com/armory-io/arm/releases) and unzip the files depending on your OS.

You can add the tool to your path by doing
ln -sf $PWD/arm /usr/local/bin/arm  

To use it just type arm in your console(if you added it to your path) or execute arm-cli directly.


```bash
âžœ  arm-0.0.3-osx-amd64 ./arm-0.0.3-darwin-amd64
The Armory Platform CLI

## Mac OS
Since arm-cli is not signed you may receive a couple of messages regarding security. To execute the binaries you need to:

1. When you execute arm-cli on the console you may see this message.

2. Open Spotlight search in your Mac OS and search for Security & Privacy.

3. Once you opened this option go to General Tab and you will see on the bottom a button to "Allow Anyway" pointing at the bin, click on it.

4. Once you click on it the button will dissapear.

5. Try to execute again the binary in your console and arm-cli should be working.

## Sample Usage
Both the Dinghyfile and module repo must be available locally, there is an example folder build in.

For example, if we use an example from the folder we can:

```bash
$ arm dinghy render ./examples/dinghyfile_globals --modules ./examples/modules --rawdata ./examples/RawData.json --output ./testing

{
  "application": "global_vars",
  "globals": {
    "waitTime": "42",
    "waitname": "default-name"
  },
  "pipelines": [
    {
      "application": "global_vars",
      "name": "Made By Armory Pipeline Templates",
      "stages": [
        {
          "name": "default-name",
          "waitTime": "42",
          "type": "wait"
        },
        {
          "name": "overwrite-name",
          "waitTime": "100",
          "type": "wait"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

If final json file is valid you can see the message `Validation passed`, this means that the final JSON object is valid.
